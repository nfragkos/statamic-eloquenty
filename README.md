# Eloquenty Statamic Addon

[![MIT Licensed](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE.md)  

:warning: **Currently in BETA. please do not use in production environments.** :warning:

This package allows you to store entries for specific collections to the database via Laravel's Eloquent ORM.

**Structures are disabled and not supported for now.**

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4+
- Statamic v3

## How it works

Eloquenty uses Statamic Eloquent Driver (https://github.com/statamic/eloquent-driver) but with modifications that allows to use the 
driver for specific collections entries instead for every entry.

Both standard and Eloquenty collections will be visible under `/cp/collections` but the Entries column will display the message 
"Managed by Eloquenty" for Eloquenty collections.

Eloquenty collections are managed on a separate route `/cp/eloquenty/collections` which is a clone of `/cp/collections` routes with 
modifications for using the DbEntry and DbRepository classes. The entry related classes and controllers are extending the Statamic 
classes thus the frontend components and experience remains the same.

There's a middleware that redirects from `/cp/collections/{collection}` to `/cp/eloquenty/collections/{collection}` when clicking 
Eloquenty collections under `/cp/collections`.

Collection modifications should be performed under the original `/cp/collections` route.



## Installation

You can install this package via composer using:

```bash
composer require nfragkos/eloquenty
```

The package will automatically register itself.

## Post-Install

1. Publish eloquenty config and migration files:

    `php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Nfragkos\Eloquenty\ServiceProvider"`


2. Run `php artisan migrate` to create Eloquenty table.  
   (Make sure laravel is configured properly and schema is created. See https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/database#configuration)  


3. Create a new collection or enter existing collection handle in config/eloquenty.php:
    
    ```bash
    'collections' => [
        'blog',
    ],
    ```

    This means that the entries for blog collection will be handled by Eloquenty.


4. If you entered an existing collection to Eloquenty config, there's an import command to import entries to the database:

    ```bash
    php artisan eloquenty:import-entries blog
    ```

   Please delete your collection entries from the filesystem after you verify that entries are imported successfully.

## Usage

Eloquenty now should be visible now under Content section of the navigation menu in Control Panel. CRUD for Eloquenty collections works
the same way as standard collections. 

### Antlers

In Antlers templates use the `eloquenty` tag instead of the collection tag for Eloquenty collections:

```
{{ eloquenty from="blog" limit="10" taxonomy:tags="demo|example" sort="date:desc" }}
    <a href="{{ url }}">{{ title }}</a>
{{ /eloquenty }}
```

## Data retrieval and manipulations

Calling the queryEntries method of Collection repository, will return the correct QueryBuilder for Eloquenty collections:
```
\Statamic\Facades\Collection::find('blog')->queryEntries()
```
Alternatively you can use the DbEntryRepository service to retrieve and manipulate Eloquenty entries:
```
app(\Nfragkos\Eloquenty\Entries\DbEntryRepository::class)
```
